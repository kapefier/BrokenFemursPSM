### HIPfracture-nonames-mock-dataset.rds

This an RDS (R Data Serialization) file. We use it to feed the main script ([analysis.R)](https://github.com/kapefier/BrokenFemursPSM/blob/main/code/analysis.R) a serialized and pre-cleaned mock dataset with tibbles and other data objects.
This is useful to code testing, while real dataset will come later on.
